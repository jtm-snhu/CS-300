# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course we learned to create and use different types of algorithms and data structures to allow for efficient data storage, manipulation, and sorting. We also learned to evaluate the runtime efficiency of various approaches to organizing and sorting data. The final project was to create a program with an efficient algorithm and data structure that could read in a list of courses with prerequisites and perform different operations on the list. The final project sorts the list into alphanumeric order, prints a complete list of all courses, and allows the user to select a specific course and print its details, including prerequisite requirements.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I tried to find an algorithm and data structure that provided a good combination of computational efficiency and code that is easy to understand and maintain. It is important to understand how different types of data structures work because the type of data structure chosen for a given purpose can have significant effects on performance. One has to consider how much data will need to be included in a list or lists, if the type or length of the data will be known before the prgoram is run, and what will need to be done with that data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

In addition to a bit of trial and error, I utilized Google and sites such as StackOverflow to find examples of things I was trying to achieve. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I can now see how important it is to consider things like memory usage and runtime evaluations when planning the development of a program or system, especially for systems that wull be handling large amounts of data. There is more than one way to perform many common operations but choosing the right one can make the difference between a program that takes milliseconds to run and one that takes minutes.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I can certainly see the value in keeping code organized and making good use of concise and descriptive comments. During the course of this project I've also learned to better break down large processes into smaller, easier to understand functions and methods. Well written functions can reduce redundancy and code duplication in addition to some being portable and usable in other programs in the future. I also try to keep in mind as I'm writing code that it should always be developed in such a way that I, or anyone else, can come back to it in the future and be able to discern what it is meant to do without any extra explanation.
