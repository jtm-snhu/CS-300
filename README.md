# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course we learned to create and use different types of algorithms and data structures to allow for efficient data storage, manipulation, and sorting. We also learned to evaluate the runtime efficiency of various approaches to organizing and sorting data. The final project was to create a program with an efficient algorithm and data structure that could read in a list of courses with prerequisites and perform different operations on the list. The final project sorts the list into alphanumeric order, prints a complete list of all courses, and allows the user to select a specific course and print its details, including prerequisite requirements.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I tried to find an algorithm and data structure that provided a good combination of computational efficiency and code that is easy to understand and maintain. It is important to understand how different types of data structures work because the type of data structure chosen for a given purpose can have significant effects on performance. One has to consider how much data will need to be included in a list or lists, if the type or length of the data will be known before the prgoram is run, and what will need to be done with that data.
